# ZypherVault

ZypherVault is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to enable secure and verifiable storage, sharing, and management of digital documents. Leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures the integrity, security, and accessibility of documents for individuals and organizations alike. Through the use of Ethereum's smart contract capabilities and cryptographic functions, ZypherVault offers a robust platform for document management in a trustless environment.

## Features

- **Secure Document Storage**: Every document is hashed and its integrity verified, ensuring that documents remain tamper-proof once uploaded.
- **Decentralized Management**: Documents are managed through a decentralized platform, removing the need for a central authority and reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **User Authentication**: Utilizes Ethereum addresses linked to public-private key pairs for user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify documents.
- **Privacy and Security**: Leveraging cryptographic techniques for secure document sharing and verification, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential.
- **Transparent Verification**: Allows for the transparent and verifiable sharing of documents, enabling third parties to verify document authenticity without compromising confidentiality.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Supports different user roles (Issuer, Resident, Requester, Admin) with specific permissions, catering to various use cases within document management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Truffle Suite
- Ganache (for local blockchain simulation)
- Metamask (or any other Ethereum wallet for interacting with the blockchain)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/ZypherVault.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
cd ZypherVault
npm install
```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
```
truffle compile
```

4. Migrate the smart contracts to your chosen network (development, testnet, or mainnet):
```
truffle migrate --network development
```

5. Run tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
```
truffle test
```

## Usage

After deploying the `ZypherVault` smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain, you can interact with it using web3.js in your frontend application or directly through Truffle's console.

For example, to register a new user:
```javascript
let result = await ZypherVault.deployed().then(instance => instance.registerUser("John", "Doe", "john.doe@example.com", 1, "+1234567890", "accessKeyExample", "publicKeyExample"));
```

Refer to the smart contract documentation for detailed information on each function and how to use them.
